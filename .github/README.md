# What is AetherMC
AetherMC is an Asynchronous, Lightweight Minecraft Server. AetherMC is made for java developers and built for developers. This is a bare bones version of Mojang's Minecraft Server. It has everything you need to make a minecraft server. AetherMC has all the essentials for creating a minecraft server quickly without any issues.

In AetherMC there is no "Main Thread" anymore. If you don't know how to properly use `Threads` or making your plugins `Thread-Safe` this isn't the Minecraft Server for you. But the main API should handle things without any major issues if you don't fully know `Thread-Safety` here is a little guide on Thread-Safety ([HERE](https://www.baeldung.com/java-thread-safety))

AetherMC is currently in development, you may be able to get a build from me if you ask nicely by contacting my through discord [My Profile](https://discord.com/users/982807217952677888)

- Commands and Events are Annotation based
  - Very simple command system, you no longer need the hastle of brigadier and `plugin.yml` anymore! Everything is handled with 1 line of code
- And More Coming Soon
  - I'm very excited to work on this project and keep it updated please check out the CHANGELOGS.md for the most recent changelogs
# API
AetherMC contains lots of Utility classes and methods to help improve your server without 500 lines of code.
The API provides many utility classes for **Math, Location, Chunk, LightingEngine, and much more** to help you.
Utility Classes:
- RegionUtils
  - This contains many QOL features to make regions in your server. By getting `borders, blocks, chunks, and more` from regions
- ChunkUtils
  - This contains methods such as `#getBorder(), #clearChunk(boolean save), and more`
  - Yes! There are chunk borders in AetherMC! Which can be used for many use cases for developers
- BlockUtils
  - This contains methods such as `#getDrops(Material material), and more`
- MathUtils
  - This contains very easy to use methods to get `Locations` like never before
- VectorUtils
  - This contains methods for rotating a vector, and changing many of its properties like the Minestoms can't
## Regions
Regions are like BoundingBoxes from `Spigot` with more featues like `Events`. These can also be saved so they can be loaded once the server starts again
## Chunks
Chunks now have "borders" borders are the outline of a chunk `16x16`. They act like regions, you can get the border of a list of chunks and it will return a outline border of all the chunks in the list
## Commands
AetherMC has a fully recoded version of Minestoms command API which is now Annotation based. Creating commands no longer needs to be inside the `plugin.yml` and will automaticlly be registered in the background
## Events
AetherMC has also recoded the events system. It is more friendly to the eye and easier to comprehend. Each event can be async or not. Here's an example: `AsyncBlockBreakEvent` or `BlockBreakEvent`
## Blocks
The block system has also been fully recoded because it didn't meet the needs of this API, blocks consist of many new methods that Minestom doesn't offer
## Worlds
The world system in AetherMC is very user friendly, it has many builders so you can let your imagination go wild with the world system
## Biomes 
Biomes haven't changed much from Minestom you can easily create a custom biome which has been changed a bit to remove the frustation of all the builders you have to deal with
