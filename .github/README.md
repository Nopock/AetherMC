# What is AetherMC
AetherMC is an Asynchronous, Lightweight Minecraft Server. AetherMC is made for java developers and built for developers. This is a bare bones version of Mojang's Minecraft Server. It has everything you need to make a minecraft server. AetherMC has all the essentials for creating a minecraft server quickly without any issues.

In AetherMC there is no "Main Thread" anymore. If you don't know how to properly use `Threads` or making your plugins `Thread-Safe` this isn't the Minecraft Server for you. But the main API should handle things without any major issues if you don't fully know `Thread-Safety` here is a little guide on Thread-Safety ([HERE](https://www.baeldung.com/java-thread-safety))

AetherMC is currently in development, you may be able to get a build from me if you ask nicely by contacting my through discord [My Profile](https://discord.com/users/982807217952677888)

> **AetherMC is a fork of Minestom**
>
> Minestom is a lightweight minecraft server.
> It doesn't contain any code from mojang
>
> You can find more details [HERE](https://minestom.net/)

## Features:
- Multi Threading
    - AetherMC allows multi-threading. We are using multi-threading for: `Setting Blocks, Updating Light, Chunk Loading, Chunk Unloading, and Plugin Loading`
- - Allows for you to create your own plugins to customize your server easily with our API
The world creator in AetherMC is using `AnvilWorld` and can easily modify your world using `Dimensions`
- AetherMC has built-in NPC support, no need for another plugin to do this for you.
- You will be able to toggle basically anything `on / off` just to maximize the performance gain of your server. This will allow you to disable anything you aren't using so it isn't using any resources in the background which is why AetherMC is so powerful
- Packet API
    - AetherMC provides a very indepth packet api to meet your needs.
- Commands and Events are Annotation based
    - Very simple command system, you no longer need the hastle of brigadier and `plugin.yml` anymore! Everything is handled with 1 line of code
- And More Coming Soon
    - I'm very excited to work on this project and keep it updated please check out the CHANGELOGS.md for the most recent changelogs

# API
AetherMC contains lots of Utility classes and methods to help improve your server without 500 lines of code.
The API provides many utility classes for **Math, Location, Chunk, LightingEngine, and much more** to help you.
Utility Classes:
- RegionUtils
    - This contains many QOL features to make regions in your server. By getting `borders, blocks, chunks, and more` from regions
- ChunkUtils
    - This contains methods such as `#getBorder(), #clearChunk(boolean save), and more`
    - Yes! There are chunk borders in AetherMC! Which can be used for many use cases for developers
- BlockUtils
    - This contains methods such as `#getDrops(Material material), and more`
- MathUtils
    - This contains very easy to use methods to get `Locations` like never before
- VectorUtils
    - This contains methods for rotating a vector, and changing many of its properties like the Minestoms can't
## Regions
Regions are like BoundingBoxes from `Spigot` with more featues like `Events`. These can also be saved so they can be loaded once the server starts again
## Chunks
Chunks now have "borders" borders are the outline of a chunk `16x16`. They act like regions, you can get the border of a list of chunks and it will return a outline border of all the chunks in the list
## Commands
AetherMC has a fully recoded version of Minestoms command API which is now Annotation based. Creating commands no longer needs to be inside the `plugin.yml` and will automaticlly be registered in the background
## Events
AetherMC has also recoded the events system. It is more friendly to the eye and easier to comprehend. Each event can be async or not. Here's an example: `AsyncBlockBreakEvent` or `BlockBreakEvent`
## Blocks
The block system has also been fully recoded because it didn't meet the needs of this API, blocks consist of many new methods that Minestom doesn't offer
## Worlds
The world system in AetherMC is very user friendly, it has many builders so you can let your imagination go wild with the world system
## Biomes
Biomes haven't changed much from Minestom you can easily create a custom biome which has been changed a bit to remove the frustation of all the builders you have to deal with
# Thanks
